# docs
The DocQL public documentation repository.

This repository will form the basis of the `Guides` section of [https://docs.docql.io](https://docs.docql.io), DocQL's API Hub.

### overview
This repository serves as the source of DocQL's public documentation and as a live example of the DocQL custom content feature in action. Though this repository is public, repositories used for DocQL's custom content feature are not required to be public.

### guides
Check out the [Guides](./guides/README.md) section of this repo for guides on specific features of the DocQL platform.

### custom content config file
A single `docql.yaml` config file is used to drive the custom content feature in DocQL. This file is expected to be at the root of its repository and defines all customizations which are to be made to the DocQL API Hub it is associated with (from within the https://app.docql.io web application), including custom user guides, theme overrides, style changes, splash page overrides and much more.

The format is as follows:

```yaml
---
# The version of the configuration spec being used (only 1.0 is currently available).
version: 1.0

#
# The config file is broken up into a few sections.
#

# Metadata for the API Hub.
meta:
  # The title of the API Hub site. This directly corresponds to the
  # HTML `title` in the `head` section of the site.
  siteTitle: string | null
  # The brand name to be used in the API Hub; depending on the theme,
  # this will typically appear in the site's title bar.
  brandName: string | null
  # The path to the brand logo image to be used in the API Hub; depending on the theme,
  # this will typically appear in the site's title bar.
  brandLogo: string | null
  # The copyright entity name to be used in the API Hub's footer; this will appear as
  # `Â© 2020 {copyright} All rights reserved.`

theme:

  name: string
  # Theme customization options.
  #
  # Every theme has different customization options, and declares those options in its description
  # and also on the docql.io/themes page for each respective theme. As such, customization options
  # should be passed in as key/value pairs under this key.
  customizations: {}

# The `schema` section is dedicated to configuring the schema section of the associated API Hub.
schema:
  # The path to the markdown file to use as the landing page for the schema section; replacing the theme's default.

  # The path to the markdown file to use as the landing page for the guide section.
  landing: string
  # A list of sections which you want to include in your custom guides.
  #
  # Sections are rendered in the order which they are listed, and depending on the theme being used,
  # will typically create a navigation element in navigation bars and the like.
  sections:
    # The path to the markdown document for this section, relative to this repo's root.
    #
    # Absolute paths, or paths which point outside of this repo's root will cause validation failure.
    - path: string
      # The name to use for this section in the table of contents.
      name: string

# Markdown parser configuration, which is applied to the target GraphQL API's schema
# docs & the markdown used in this custom content repo.
